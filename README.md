Study Duration, Habits, and Influences on Academic Performance

Description:

This repository presents an SQL data analysis report investigating the relationship between various factors and student academic performance. Key findings reveal how study duration, extracurricular activities, stress levels, commute times, and other variables influence academic success.

Analysis and Key Findings:

Study Duration and Performance: A positive correlation exists, suggesting that students who dedicate more time to studying tend to achieve better academic results.
Extracurricular Activities: Students participating in sports exhibit the highest performance, while those involved in video games generally have lower academic outcomes.
Gender Differences: Male students, on average, demonstrate slightly higher academic performance compared to female students.
Stress Levels: Interestingly, students with moderate ("good") stress levels perform best. Conversely, those with very low stress ("fabulous") perform the worst, suggesting an optimal stress zone for academic success.
Degree Satisfaction and Career Aspirations: Students intending to pursue careers in their field of study tend to be more satisfied with their chosen degree. Similarly, students with high salary expectations generally express higher degree satisfaction.
Field of Study and Career Pursuit: Students enrolled in BCA, Commerce, and B.Com programs are most likely to pursue careers aligned with their field of study.
Salary Expectations and Course Type: Notably, students seeking high salaries are more likely to be enrolled in certificate courses.
Academic Performance by Department: The Commerce department boasts students with the highest recorded marks (including a perfect score of 100). The BCA department also exhibits strong academic performance.
Financial Status and Employment: Students with part-time jobs typically report a good financial status.
Commute Time and Performance: Students with 30-60 minute commutes achieve the highest academic marks. Conversely, those with very long commutes (2.5 hours or more) demonstrate the lowest performance.
Physical Characteristics: Height and weight do not appear to significantly impact academic performance.
Conclusion:

These findings highlight the multifaceted nature of factors influencing academic success. Understanding these relationships can inform interventions and initiatives designed to support student achievement.

Further Exploration:

The repository does not include the actual SQL code or data used in the analysis. Consider adding them if they are anonymized and can be shared publicly. This would allow for reproducibility and potential further exploration by others.

Additional Notes:

The report title has been adjusted to be more descriptive and informative.
The description provides a concise summary of the project's purpose and findings.
The analysis and key findings section is structured for clarity and readability.
While the gender difference finding is present, it's important to acknowledge potential biases in the data or broader societal factors that might contribute to this observation.
The conclusion emphasizes the importance of understanding these relationships for supporting student learning.
The concept of an "optimal stress zone" is intriguing and could be explored further in future investigations.
The lack of significant impact from physical characteristics is noted.
The possibility of including the SQL code and data (if anonymized) is mentioned for potential reproducibility and exploration.
